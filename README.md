## 🧑‍💻 Development Guidelines
To ensure a clean and collaborative codebase, we follow the standards below.

### 🧾 Coding Standards
We adhere to PEP 8 — the official Python style guide.
Linting and formatting tools:

**black** – auto-formatting

**flake8** – style enforcement and static analysis

**isort** – import sorting

>Run black . && isort . && flake8 before committing.

###  🌱 Branching Strategy

We use a GitHub Flow-inspired model:

main – Stable release code (production-ready)

dev – Active development (integration of all features)

feature/your-feature-name – Individual features, merged into dev via PR

hotfix/bug-description – Urgent fixes, merged into main and dev

__Workflow:__

Branch from dev

Create and push to feature/your-feature-name

Open PR into dev and request review

After testing, dev is merged into main for release
